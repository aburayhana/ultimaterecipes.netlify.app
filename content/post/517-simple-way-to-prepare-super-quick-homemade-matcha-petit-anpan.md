recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the egg yolk, matcha liquor, milk together and mix. Put all ingredients for the bread dough except the butter in the bread machine. Add the yeast according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions."
- "Start the dough kneading course. After kneading 5 minutes, add butter and let the bread machine do the job until the 1st proofing."
- "After the 1st proofing, take out the dough, and press gently with your hands to eliminate air. Divide the dough into 15 pieces using a scraper and shape each dough round. One piece of dough will be about 32 g."
- "Cover the dough with a tightly wrung out kitchen towel and let it sit for 10 minutes."
- "After letting the dough sit, roll out each dough into a 10cm  diameter round shape. The middle part should be a little thicker creating a gentle mound shape."
- "Flip over the dough. Make a dent with your palm and place the dough on. Place the sweetened bean paste on the dough using an an-spatula. When placing the sweetened bean past on the dough, make the dent of you palm deeper while pressing the sweetened beans paste in, then the dough around will come up."
- "Pinch the dough around and close the seam completely. The seam will not stick together if there is sweetened bean paste on it, so be careful. One piece will be about 30g."

- "Place the seam down, and roll the dough with your hands to shape it nicely. Press the dough from above and make it flat."
- "Use the bread-rising function of the oven let the dough sit in 35℃ for 40 to 45 minutes for the 2nd proofing. When the dough increases in size by 1.5 times it is ready. The picture shows the state before the second proofing."
- "I check whether the proofing is finished by gently touching the surface of the dough with my index finger. If it feels sticky, I let it proof a bit longer."
- "When the texture feels more springy and it doesn&#39;t sticks to your finger, then the dough has proofed enough. If the dough starts to sag, then it was proofed too long. The picture is for after the 2nd proofing."
- "After proofing, start preheating the oven to 200℃. In the mean time, brush beaten egg onto the surface of the dough and stick black sesame seeds to top."
- "The black sesame seeds will stick nicely if you use a rolling pin. Moisten the tip of the rolling pin and stick the black sesame seeds on. Then press the tip of the rolling pin onto the dough like a stamp. The black sesame seeds will stick nicely."
- "Reduce the oven temperature to 190℃ and bake for about 15 minutes. How long to bake depends on the oven, so adjust the baking time according to your oven. Let the anpan cool on a rack when they are done."
- "This is how it looks when the anpan is cut into half. Fully loaded with the anko. The green matcha color is also beautiful."
- "The alcohol in the matcha liquor evaporates when you bake it. The anpan will not have the liquor taste, but the flavor will remain."
- "You can get this in a baking specialty store or in a big supermarket, so please give it a try."
