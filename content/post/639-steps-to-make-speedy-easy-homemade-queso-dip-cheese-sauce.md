- "Saute for 1 to 2 minutes until the onions are soft and you get a nice aroma from the slightly fried onions, green chillies and green onions. Stir in milk (start with ¼ cup) and bring to a boil on medium heat, stirring constantly."
- "When the milk comes to a low simmer, add about 3 to 4 slices of cheese, roughly cut up and continue to stir. Whisk until the mixture turns smooth and creamy. If you find the queso mixture too runny, add more cheese slices one at a time until you get the desired consistency of the cheese dip."

- "You can add any type of cheese you have like grated cheddar cheese, mozzarella, tinned cheese etc. as long as they melt while heating. Stir in more jalapenos, red onions or green onions for more flavor and crunch.  For a different aroma, try adding some dried oregano leaves, basil or even finely chopped cilantro/coriander leaves in the cheesy mixture."
- "Store leftovers in the refrigerator in airtight containers; reheat adding more milk to loosen the dip, stirring well."
