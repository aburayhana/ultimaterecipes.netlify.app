recipeinstructions:
- "How to choose Banana blossom: How to choose plantain Flower: Select a firm one with tightly packed petals. The Blossom should be Purplish Red in color. Make sure it is not wilted off or decayed. If storing in a refrigerator wrap it up with a cling/plastic wrap."
- "Cleaning: The Purplish Leaf-like part of the Blossom is called the &#39;Bracts&#39;. First, peel of the bracts, beneath these you can see a row of delicate light-yellow coloured Florets.  Remove the florets and immediately soak them in an acidic water to avoid discoloration and bitterness. Continue to peel the bracts and remove the florets until you see a pale yellow coloured centre portion once the leaves become too small to peel."
- "Trim the stem and discard it. Once sliced it will produce a sticky white sap. Finely chop them or cut them into the desired shape to suit your recipe and immerse it immediately in acidic water and let sit for 30 minutes to remove the bitter sap and avoid browning."
- "What you need to clean are the light -yellow colour florets.  We have to remove the thin sticks in the center called Pistils and the outermost small scale like petal called Calyx.  Remove the Pistils and the Calyx from the florets."
- "Soak the cleaned florets in an acidic water for at least 30 minutes.  Before using them rinse in cold water, drain and squeeze out excess water."
- "Cooking: Wash the Mocha properly with clean water and chop it. Now Boil it on stove and drain the water using strainer after boiling. Marinate the prawns with salt, one pinch of turmeric powder. Keep it aside."
- "Now take a frying pan, put some mustard oil and heat it on the stove. Put the prawns and fry one minute. Now Put the chopped onions with green chillies and salt as required and fry it until it&#39;s become golden brown. Now put ginger garlic paste into it stir fry more 1 minutes."
- "Now put turmeric powder, red chilli powder, Coriander and cumin powder into it and stir fry it using water as required."
- "When water becomes vanish and oil is coming from the Spices, add the boiled banana blossom into it and stir fry covering the frypan for 15-20 minutes."
- "After it&#39;s done stop the flame immediately. Bengali tasty Mocha Chingri is ready to serve. Enjoy !."
