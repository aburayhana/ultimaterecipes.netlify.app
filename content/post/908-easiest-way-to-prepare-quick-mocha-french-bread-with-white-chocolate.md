- "100 grams Bread strong flour"
- "100 grams Cake flour"
- "1 tbsp Cocoa powder"
- "1 tbsp Instant coffee granules"
- "3 grams Salt"
- "145 grams Lukewarm water"
- "2 grams Dry yeast"
- "3 to 4 drops Lemon juice"
- "30 to 40 grams White chocolate"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the water in a bowl, warm it up in the microwave, and dissolve the cocoa and coffee in it."
- "When the liquid has cooled down, add all the ingredients, excluding the white chocolate, to the bread maker and knead for 7 minutes. Stop the program at that point. Take the dough out into a bowl, and leave it to rise to 2 to 3 times its original volume (1st rising)."
- "Take the dough out gently onto a floured work surface, round it off lightly, cover with a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel and leave to rest for 15 minutes."
- "Flatten the dough out gently, trying not to push out the air bubbles in the dough. Top with plenty of chopped chocolate, roll the dough up from the end and form into a long, thin shape."
- "If you are making two loaves, divide the chocolate chips too. Stretch the dough out very gently, or the chocolate chips will pop out."
- "Place the formed dough on a piece of kitchen parchment paper, and hold the shape using a canvas mat. Leave until it has risen to 1.5 times its original size (2nd rising). Preheat the oven to 250°C, timing it to when the dough finishes rising."
- "Preheat the oven tray as well as the oven. Place the dough with the kitchen parchment paper on the hot oven tray, slash the tops and mist well."
- "Bake for 30 to 40 minutes until well done. The chocolate chips come jumping out from the slashed tops."
- "The slash opened up nicely, and the edges have curled open neatly too."
- "The air pockets...are a bit small in this dough. It does tastes properly of mocha and chocolate! The crust is crisp and chewy!"
- "It&#39;s a pretty expected combination, but this bread is also delicious with some orange peel kneaded into the mocha dough."
- "The bitterness, sourness and sweetness is delicious."
