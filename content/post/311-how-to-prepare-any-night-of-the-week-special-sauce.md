Special Sauce strain flowers smell grassy and green. The first impression is rather refreshing, but they you&#39;ll feel the strong tone of the resin smell that reminds gasoline. Tangy notes of lemon and pine nicely combine with the sour smell, camouflaging it and bringing the habitual fragrance of weed. Combine the mayonnaise, mustard, relish, ketchup, vinegar, garlic powder, onion powder and paprika in a medium bowl and whisk until well blended. Our Special Sauce flower is hoppy, earthy, and sweet with a hint of cinnamon and orange.
