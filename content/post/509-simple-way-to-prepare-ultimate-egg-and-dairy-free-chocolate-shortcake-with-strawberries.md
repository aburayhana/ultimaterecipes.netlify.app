The week I first made this recipe also marked my first my birthday as a gluten-free, dairy-free, and Perhaps it&#39;s because I grew up in Texas with its Southern traditions, but to me a strawberry shortcake must be on a biscuit, not a sponge cake, pound cake, or any other. Made without a single egg or dairy product, this egg-free and dairy-free chocolate cake is rich and flavorful, and tastes just like the real deal. I also added some melted dark chocolate and a little cocoa powder with the powdered sugar. It&#39;s a creamy, silky frosting but does tend to harden as it sits.
