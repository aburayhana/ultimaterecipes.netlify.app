By this time the potatoes start to look golden brown."
- "In a bowl take ½ cup water and add the cumin, coriander and red chilli powder. Mix well. Add it to the potatoes along with the tomato paste. Mix well and cook on a low flame. If required ¼ cup of water can be added. Now drain the boiled mocha and add it to the potatoes. Add salt and sugar to taste and mix everything well. The curry is dry, so you should wait for it to come together and continue to cook on a low flame."
- "Once done, remove from heat and add garam masala and ghee. Mix well. Serve along side white rice. You can sprinkle lemon juice for taste."
