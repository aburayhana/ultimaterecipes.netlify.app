recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the banana flowers prior in advance. Separate all the inner florets neatly arranged inside each purplish-maroon petal. Discard all the thick maroon petals, until you almost reach the core where the petals aren’t red anymore. As you approach the core, the petals become interlocked. As these petals are comparatively much softer, we will chop off the whole little cone very finely, which we obtained from the inside part of a mocha."
- "After removing the unwanted parts from each flower, these flowers are chopped finely and soaked immediately (to prevent blackening) for a few hours in a dish of water with salt and turmeric powder. Soaking helps in getting rid of bitterness. This water is strained after at least three hours and discarded. The banana flowers are now transferred to a pressure cooker with some water and salt. Let it have three whistles on a simmered flame."
- "Heat oil in a pan. When the oil is hot, reduce the flame and add the bay leaf, dried red chillies and the whole Garam masala (cinnamon, cloves and green cardamoms). Add the cumin seeds and wait until the colour changes to light brown. Add the potatoes and fry it till golden brown. Add the brown chickpeas. Using water, make a paste of the cumin powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, salt and ginger paste."
- "When the aroma of the spices emanates from the pan (i.e., after around 2 min of cooking), add the cooked and semi-mashed banana flowers or mocha. Add chilli powder, salt and sugar. On a high flame, cook it for around 15 min, sautéing continuously, until most of the water dries out."
- "Open the lid. Sauté continuously, adding fried coconut pieces, sugar and the ghee. Also add the garam masala. Cook until little oil/ghee leaves the sides of the pan. Check for the salt. In case more salt is needed, add at this stage and cook for 2 min, until well-mixed. Mochar ghoto is slightly on sweeter side, so check the sugar and adjust as per taste."
- "Garnish with around freshly grated coconut. Serve the Mochar Ghonto hot with steamed rice."
