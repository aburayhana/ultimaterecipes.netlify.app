recipeinstructions:

- "Add Jif spread to a small bowl and soften by stirring liberally. Pour spread across entire center of dough rectangle. Leave only about 1 inch of empty space on each side. NOTE: Spread will not cover every bit of the inside. Do not spread too hard or it will tear through the dough."
- "Starting with the 12-inch side closest to you, roll the dough tightly until a log is formed. Gently place the log in a baking dish and form into a ring shape."
- "Using your fingers, dampen the top of the entire ring with water and dust with 3 tbsp of sugar."
