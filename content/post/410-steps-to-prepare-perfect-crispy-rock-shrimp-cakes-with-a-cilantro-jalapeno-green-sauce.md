Flour tortillas filled with plump, succulent shrimp, refreshing cilantro lime slaw, and topped with spicy mayo. The zingy spiciness of the sauce, along with its cool creaminess, had the perfect well-rounded balancing effect to the spicy, golden brown, crispy cornmeal beer-battered fish. A little Cotija cheese crumbled on top gave a little texture and saltiness, and those few little cilantro leaves added a fresh-green-pop look that tied it all together. Jalapeños are the most popular chile peppers in the US.
