recipeingredient:
- "3 large boneless skinless chicken breasts"
- "1 purple onion"
- "1 green pepper"
- "1 sweet pepper"
- "1 can whole kernel corn"
- "1 can black beans"
- "1 1/2 cups rice"
- "1/4 cup olive oil"
- " Salt and pepper"
- " Misc seasoning blend I used Tony Chacheres creole blend"
- "strips Tortilla chip"
- " sauce"
- "1 cup milk"
- "2 tbsp miracle whip"
- "1 tbsp sour cream"
- "1 dash lime juice"
- "1/2 packet ranch dressing mix"
- "1-2 tsp cumin"
- "1-2 tsp chili powder"
- "1 pinch oregano"
- " Fresh chopped cilantro"
- "1 Pinch salt"
- "1 pinch black pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prep the peppers and onion by cutting them into strips, about 1/2 inch thick. Lay everything out on a cookie sheet lined with foil, chicken in the middle, peppers on one end and onions on the other. Drizzle everything with the olive oil and toss a little bit so it&#39;s all coated. Sprinkle peppers and onions with a pinch of salt and pepper. Sprinkle the chicken with your misc. seasoning."
- "Bake on middle oven rack at 375 for 30-40 minutes (depending on how thick the chicken boobs are) Make the rice according to package directions. I used jasmine rice. -- while that&#39;s cooking, make the sauce."
- "Sauce- again, this sauce makes the whole thing. This sauce is the robin to Batman. The Louise to Thelma. The Mallory to Mickey. The gravy to KFC&#39;s mashed potatoes... you get the idea.. In a separate container combine the milk, miracle whip and sour cream. Add the dash of lime juice. Whip with a fork till it&#39;s all combined. Add all the spice ingredients and whip again to combine. Add the fresh cilantro last and just let it relax on top. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours. Mix"
- "Side note about the sauce. I didn&#39;t use actual measurements for anything when making mine, so this is just a guideline. Keep tasting and adjusting accordingly. I like spicy, bold flavor. Also you&#39;re looking for the consistency to be a tad thicker than milk."
- "Ok. When the oven is done let everything cool enough to handle with your bare hands. Slice the chicken across the grain. Now we build the bowls."
- "I made 4 portions out of this and honestly it was a lot of food haha probably could&#39;ve made 5 instead but I only had 4 Tupperware containers. Don&#39;t forget to drain the corn and black beans. Lay out a layer of tortilla strips (yes they will lose their crunch but that&#39;s what I wanted. Just the corn tortilla flavor) Next, a layer of rice. In one corner a couple spoons of corn. The other corner, some of the onion. Another corner, black beans. In the last corner some of the pepper strips."
- "Sprinkle all of it with a bit more of the spice blend. Garnish with fresh cilantro. They should somewhat resemble the photo. Now lunches are ready for the week! Bring a separate container of the sauce and you&#39;re set!"
- "When reheating this at work, I microwave for about a minute, cut up the chicken into bite size pieces, mix it all together and finish reheating. THEN drizzle the white sauce all over it. One round of cooking and you&#39;ve got a weeks worth of home cooked lunches your coworkers will be jealous of you over!----- P.S (search &#34;sheet pan chicken&#34; on YouTube and there&#39;s a cool little minute long demo of the oven part of this, which inspired this recipe)"
