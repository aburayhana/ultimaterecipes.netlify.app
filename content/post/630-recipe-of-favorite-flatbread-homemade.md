recipeinstructions:
- "Mix flour, olive oil, salt together. Add some water slowly while kneaded the mix together until perfectly mixed."
- "Cover the dough for 10 mins with clean cloth to let it rest. Meanwhile, grated the cheese for the filling and put aside."
- "After that, divide the dough into small balls by using a spoon. Take one ball and spread it enough to put the grated cheese inside. Rounded them again and put aside."
- "When ready to cook, flatten the dough with the cheese inside and smeared some olive oil on it so it won’t be sticky to the hand."
- "Heat up your pan on stove with a pinch of olive oil to cook the dough. If you prefer margarine, you can also use a margarine. Put the flattened dough inside and cook with small fire on both side for approx. 2-3 minutes each. Or until you see the dough becomes slight transparent in color and no longer whitish."
- "Serve it while hot."
- "If you prefer to bake it in the oven, you can put the dough on a aluminum foil with some olive oil rubbed on both side. Set the oven up to 250•Celsius and let it heat up for about 3-5 minutes before putting the dough in. My oven will cook for about 5 minutes for each side. Remember to check that both side are properly baked."
