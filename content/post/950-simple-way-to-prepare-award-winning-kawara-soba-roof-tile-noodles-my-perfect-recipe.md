recipeingredient:
- "4 servings Dried cha soba noodles flavored with green tea"
- " Sweet and salty beef topping"
- "200 grams Thinly sliced beef  chuck or flank"
- "1 to 2 tablespoons Soy sauce"
- "2 tbsp Sugar"
- "1 tbsp Mirin"
- " Shredded Usuyaki Tamago"
- "2 Eggs"
- "2 tsp Sugar"
- "1 pinch Salt"
- " Other Toppings"
- "4 pieces Nori seaweed for rice balls"
- "4 pieces Sliced lemon"
- "1 Daikon radish"
- "1 Green onion or scallion"
- "50 ml x 4 Sauce for kawara soba or mentsuyu"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cook the cha-soba noodles. Boil a pot full of water and cook the noodles for a little shorter than the suggested time. If the directions say to boil it for 5 minutes, about 3 minutes should be fine."
- "Drain in a colander, and rinse with cold running water. If you can, tighten up the noodles with ice water and drain well so they don&#39;t soften too quickly."
- "Make the usuyaki tamago (thin and flat omelette) and cool it down."
- "Heat the oil in a skillet, sauté the beef and add the seasoning and 40 ml of water. Simmer until shiny (about 15 minutes)."
- "You can preseason the beef to your preference as well."
- "Shred the egg."
- "Thinly slice the lemon.  Grate the daikon radish and drain the excess liquid, and chop the green onion finely."
- "Warm up the sauce.  If you are using regular mentsuyu, add about 30 ml of mirin and simmer it for a while (so the sauce will be a little sweeter.)"
- "Heat an electric griddle or a skillet, coat it with 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil (not listed), and sauté the cha-soba noodles lightly."
- "Spread the noodles in the skillet, top it with the shredded egg, beef topping, nori seaweed, lemon, grated daikon, and the scallion in that order. Sprinkle some ichimi red chili pepper if desired."
- "Wait until the noodles start to scorch a little, about 4 minutes over low heat. It&#39;s better to have a crunchy part and a soft part."
- "Put a lemon slice and grated daikon into the individual bowl with the sauce already in it.  Wrap the noodles with a piece of nori seaweed and it is perfect!"
- "The secret to its deliciousness is the harmony of the condiments. Prepare all the toppings if possible."
- "Grocery stores near our house have been carrying a &#34;Kawara soba set&#34; as of late. It comes with dipping sauce as well, so it&#39;s very convenient! The precooked noodles are pretty good, too."
- "&#34;vegecat-san&#34; made a canned tuna version recipe.  Give it a try!"
- "It&#39;s so tasty, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it became the official dish of an eating competition. &#34;Nanakobu-san&#34;&#39;s recommendation is to serve it individually beforehand."
- "This is my friend K&#39;s idea. She used an actual leftover roof tile! It has some uneven parts, but it is esthetically nice!"
