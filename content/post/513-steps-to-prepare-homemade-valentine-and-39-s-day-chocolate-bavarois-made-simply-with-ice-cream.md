recipeingredient:
- " Gelatin powder"
- " Water for dissolving gelatin"
- " Sugar"
- " Milk for melting gelatin"
- " Van Houten pure cocoa"
- " Milk to cool the mixture and add creaminess"
- " Vanilla ice cream"
- " Chocolate liqueur"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put 60 ml of water into a microwave-safe container and sprinkle 1 tablespoon of gelatin powder. Leave for 5 minutes."
- "Add sugar and 100 ml of milk and heat in the microwave for 1 minute 20 seconds. Make sure the liquid temperature is over 140F/60C."
- "Take out and mix well. Check for lumps of gelatin. If there are lumps, microwave for longer."
- "Add 5 tablespoons of cocoa powder on top."
- "Mix while pouring 250 ml of cold milk (to reduce the temperature). Lumps of cocoa will end up like chocolate chips and taste great."
- "If you have chocolate liqueur, add 1 tablespoon. It&#39;s not essential (rum makes a good match too), but now&#39;s not the time to slack off!"
- "Cut the ice cream. Prepare when carrying out Step 1. (It will make it melt better) If you use an expensive high milk fat content ice cream, it will have a richer flavour."
- "Without resting, mix in the ice cream completely while reducing the temperature."
- "At this point, it should be quite runny. Quickly pour into containers."
- "The ones pictured back right are mini pudding heart shaped containers with lids. The others are silicon."
- "Even with silicon containers, they&#39;ll come out cleanly. I unmolded it over melted vanilla ice cream. It makes you want to decorate with fruit to make it cute!"
- "The easiest to remove are the mini pudding shapes. I bought them at the dollar store."
- "If you have trouble taking them out, leave overnight in the refrigerator until they are set properl,y then take out."
