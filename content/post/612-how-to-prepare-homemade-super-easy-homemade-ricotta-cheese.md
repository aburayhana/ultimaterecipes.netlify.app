recipeingredient:
- "1 liter full cream milk"
- "225 ml heavy cream"
- "1/4 cup white distilled vinegar"
- "1/2 tsp salt optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the milk and cream in a deep saucepan."
- "Heat the mixture on medium until it starts to simmer. IMPORTANT: Stir occasionally to refrain from burning and NEVER leave it unattended as milk can easily boil over."
- "Once it starts to simmer, turn off the heat and add in your vinegar. Stir well."
- "Wait for 10 minutes and observe as your milk starts to curdle. If it doesn&#39;t work, add more vinegar until milk solids/gobules appear."
- "While waiting for the milk to curdle, prepare your filter. Line a colander or strainer with 4 layers of cheesecloth or paper towels."
- "Pour the mixture over your strainer. The water that comes out of it is whey. You can save it and use in other recipes if you want."
- "Mix in the salt and do a taste test. You may add in more salt if you want."
- "Now the last step is to wait for the draining to finish. There is no definite time on how long it should be drained. I drained mine overnight in the fridge to make sure that no whey is left. If you want a creamy version, drain it for 10-20 minutes."
- "And once you remove it from the strainer, tada! Homemade ricotta! Yummy! This will keep good for 4-5 days in the fridge."
