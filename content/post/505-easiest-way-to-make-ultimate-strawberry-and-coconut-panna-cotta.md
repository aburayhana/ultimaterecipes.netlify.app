recipeinstructions:

- "Soak three (red) gelatin sheets for 5 minutes in cold water. The red sheets are only to support the colour of the panna cotta. When you use white/colourless gelatine the panna cotta will have a blushing pink tone."
- "Put the hot strawberry and cream mix in a food processor. Mix and add gelatine. Now you can - if you like - sift out the tiny cores and pour the panna cotta in a bowl or glasses. Let come to room temperature and the let set in the refrigerator for 3 hours until gelatinesed."
- "For the coconut panna cotta: Soak three sheets of gelatin for 5 minutes in cold water. Heat coconut milk with sugar on medium heat and let simmer for 5 minutes. Add liqueur and gelatin."
- "Let cool for 45 minutes to almost room temperature, stir from time to time so the liqueur has no chance to drop to the bottom of the pan."
- "Then pour it on top of the strawberry panna cotta. And let set in the refrigerator until firm. Before serving top with cut strawberries and/or coconut flakes."
- "You can, of course, also serve the panna cottas each by themselves. In this photo I combined the strawberry panna cotta with a balsamic vinegar sauce (100 ml balsamic vinegar, 100 ml red wine, 50 g sugar in a small pan, heated and reduced to one third). That&#39;s a suprisingly good combination. The coconut panna cotta is great with a raspberry sauce. :)"
- "For the photo on top I made a salad of straberries and mint leaves with agave syrup as a refreshing topping. Enjoy!"
