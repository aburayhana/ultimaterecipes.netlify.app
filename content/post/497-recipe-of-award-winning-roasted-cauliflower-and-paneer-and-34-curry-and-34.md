recipeingredient:
- " a head of cauliflower"
- " garlic cloves peeled"
- " olive oil or sesame oil"
- " red onions"
- " cube root ginger"
- " red chilli"
- " heaped teaspoon of Nigella seeds"
- " heaped teaspoon cumin"
- " turmeric"
- " cayenne pepper"
- " chopped tomatoes"
- " tin chickpeas"
- " cup frozen peas"
- " fresh spinach could use frozen"
- " half a pack paneer Indian cheese"
- " salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat the oven to 200˚c. Cut the cauliflower into small florets and lightly toss in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil."
- "Put in a roasting dish and cook in the preheated oven for approx 30 - 40 minutes, depending on how crisp you like it. Remember not to overcook it as it needs some bite to stay together in the finished dish."
- "Whilst your cauliflower is cooking, add half a tablespoon of oil to a pan and fry your onions, ginger and chilli for 5 minutes to release the flavour."
- "Add the dry spices to the pan and continue to fry for a minute or so longer."
- "Add the drained chickpeas to the pan, coat in the spice mixture and then add the tomatoes. Simmer on a low/medium heat for approx. 10-15 minutes until slightly reduced."
- "Heat the remaining olive oil on a small non-stick frying pan and cook the paneer over a medium to high heat until crisp and lightly brown. This should take about 5 minutes. Remember to keep stirring every minute or so to stop it form catching. (If you like really crispy paneer, you can coat it in some cornflour or semolina beforehand.)"
- "Whilst the paneer is cooking, add the roasted cauliflower and garlic, peas and spinach to the sauce and cook for 5 minutes until the peas and spinach are cooked through."
- "Once your paneer is cooked, add it to the cauliflower and sauce and serve in warm bowls. This makes a great meat-free main meal but is also lovely as a side dish served with chicken tikka or pan fried spicy salmon."
