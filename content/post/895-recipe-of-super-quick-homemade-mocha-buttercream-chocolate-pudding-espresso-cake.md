I like to use Dutch-process cocoa powder as it&#39;s richer in flavour, but. white chocolate mocha cake with an espresso caramel swiss meringue buttercream; cake is loaded with white chocolate, espresso, half and half and butter; a delicious combination that results in a tender, beautifully textured cake full of my favorite flavors; if one shot of espresso is not enough. Chocoalte Mocha Cake is made up of eight chocolate cake layers frosted with coffee flavored Swiss meringue buttercream and topped with toasted Oddly enough, I don&#39;t like chocolate in my coffee, so I don&#39;t like mochas but I LOVE mocha flavored dessertsâ€¦and this chocolate cake with coffee. I absolutely LOVE the dark chocolate/espresso bars. I always stock up when they are on sale.
