Line a sieve or colander with a cheesecloth, and pour the milk through the cloth to catch the curds. What is left in the cheesecloth is the Farmer&#39;s Cheese. Some people keep the whey and drink it, but I throw it away. Bring your milk or cream to a boil in a heavy-bottomed pan, stirring frequently. The type of dairy you choose affects both the flavor and texture of the cheese.
